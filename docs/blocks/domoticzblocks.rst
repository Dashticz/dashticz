Domoticz blocks
===============

Several types of Domoticz blocks can be defined:

* Devices
* Scenes
* Groups
* Variables

Devices
-------

Almost all Domoticz devices can be shown on the Dashticz dashboard.
Before you can use a device in a column you must make it known in your CONFIG.js as follows::

   blocks = {}        //only once
   blocks[123] = {
    title: 'My device',
    width: 12
   }
   
The number ``123`` is the Domoticz device id. The example above also shows the use of two parameters: ``title`` and ``width``.
For a full list of parameters see :ref:`dom_blockparameters`.

For most devices containing a value, like temperature, power, etc, it's possible to show the data as a graph. See :ref:`dom_graphs`.

Scenes and Groups
-----------------

To select a Domoticz Group or Scene add 's' in front of the Scene/Group ID.

Example::

    blocks['s12'] = {    //Select group/scene with Domoticz index 12
      title: 'My group 12'
    }


Variables
---------

To select a Domoticz variable add 'v' in front of the Domoticz variable ID. 

Example::

    blocks['v3'] = {    //Select variable with Domoticz index 3
      title: 'My variable 3'
    }

After that you can use ``'v3'`` in your column definitions in ``CONFIG.js`` as usual.

A list of all Domoticz variables can be obtained via::

Usage
-----

.. _blocktitle :

Block title
~~~~~~~~~~~

A special block type is a block title.
You define a block title as follows::

  blocks['blocktitle_1'] = {  //'blocktitle_1' must be an unique name
    type: 'blocktitle',       //Set type to 'blocktitle' (required for block title)
    title: 'Switches',        //The title of the block as shown in the dashboard.
    width: 6,                 //The width of the block relative to the column width
    icon: 'far fa-lightbulb', //If you want  to show an icon, choose from: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free
    image: 'lightbulb.png'    //If you want to show an image instead if icon, place image in img/ folder    
  }
  
Full example of one block title and two devices::

    var config = {}
    config['language : 'nl_NL'; //or: en_US, de_DE, fr_FR, hu_HU, it_IT, pt_PT, sv_SV
    config['domoticz_ip : 'http://192.168.178.18:8080';
    config['domoticz_refresh : '5';
    config['dashticz_refresh : '60';

    config['use_favorites'] = 0; //Request all Domoticz Devices, not only favorites

    //Definition of blocks
    blocks = {}

    blocks['myblocktitle'] = {
      type: 'blocktitle',
      title: 'My Devices Block'
    }

    blocks[120] = {
      width: 6
    }

    blocks[121] = {
      width: 6
    }

    //Definition of columns
    columns = {}

    columns[1] = { 
      blocks: ['myblocktitle', 120, 121],
      width: 4
    }

    //Definition of screens
    screens = {}
    screens[1] = {
      columns: [1]
    }

This example will give the following result:

.. image :: blocktitle.jpg

Example of a more extensive block definition::

    var blocks = {}

    blocks[1] = {
      width: 4,               //1 to 12, remove this line if you want to use the default (4)
      title : 'Living room',  //if you want change the name of switch different then domoticz
      icon : 'fa-eye',        //if you want an other icon instead of the default, choose from: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free
      image : 'bulb_off.png', //if you want to show an image instead if icon, place image in img/ folder
      switch : true,          //if you want to switch the title and data
      hide_data : true,       //if you want to hide the data of this block
      last_update : true,     //if you want to show the last update specific for this block
      playsound : 'sounds/ping.mp3', //play a sound when a device changes
      protected : true,       //protect switching manually in Dashticz
      speak : 'Device status has changed',  //speak text when device is changed
      gotoslide: 2            //Goto screen when a device changes
    };  


.. _openpopup :

Usage of openpopup(On)(Off)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the openpopup, openpopupOn and openpopupOff parameter you can configure to open a popup window when the device changes. Example::

  blocks[123]['openpopup'] = {
      url: 'http://www.urltocamera.nl/image.jpg',   //Open a popup window with this url when the device changes
      framewidth:500,                               //specific width of the frame
      frameheight:400,                              //specific height of the frame
      autoclose: 5                                  //autoclose the popup window after 5 seconds.
  } 
  
  blocks[123]['openpopupOn'] = {
      url: 'http://www.urltocamera.nl/image.jpg',   //Open a popup window with this url when the device changes to On
      framewidth:500,                               //specific width of the frame
      frameheight:400,                              //specific height of the frame
      autoclose: 5                                  //autoclose the popup window after 5 seconds.
  } 
  
  blocks[123]['openpopupOff'] = {
      url: 'http://www.urltocamera.nl/image.jpg',   //Open a popup window with this url when the device changes to Off
      framewidth:500,                               //specific width of the frame
      frameheight:400,                              //specific height of the frame
      autoclose: 5                                  //autoclose the popup window after 5 seconds.
  } 

To remove the close button of the block-popup add the following text to custom.css::

  .frameclose { display: none; }


.. _Flashonchange:

Flash on change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To control the flashing of the block when it's value change you can set the ``flash`` parameter.
Via the style ``blockchange`` in ``custom.css`` you can set the class-style that needs to be applied.

Example ``CONFIG.js``::

  blocks[123] = {             //123 is the Domoticz device ID
    title: 'My new device',
    flash: 500                //flash effect of 500 ms
  }
  
Example ``custom.css`` (only needed in case you want to change the default flash effect)::

  .blockchange {
    background-color: #0f0 !important;	
  }
