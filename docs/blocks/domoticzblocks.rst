Domoticz blocks
===============

Several types of Domoticz blocks can be defined:

* Devices
* Scenes
* Groups
* Variables
* Texts

Devices
-------

Almost all Domoticz devices can be shown on the Dashticz dashboard.
Before you can use a device in a column you must make it known in your CONFIG.js as follows::

   blocks = {}        //only once
   blocks[123] = {
    title: 'My device',
    width: 12
   }
   
If you use anything other than a number you have to put it between quotes: ``['s1']`` ``['v3']`` ``['123_1']``

The number ``123`` is the Domoticz device id. The example above also shows the use of two parameters: ``title`` and ``width``.
For a full list of parameters see :ref:`dom_blockparameters`.

For most devices containing a value, like temperature, power, etc, it's possible to show the data as a graph. See :ref:`dom_graphs`.

You can also use custom names for the block identfier. In that case you have to add the ``idx`` parameter to indicate which Domoticz device you want to use::

   blocks['my device'] = {
      idx: 123
   }

Scenes and Groups
-----------------

To select a Domoticz Group or Scene add 's' in front of the Scene/Group ID.

Example::

    blocks['s12'] = {    //Select group/scene with Domoticz index 12
      title: 'My group 12'
    }


Variables
---------

To select a Domoticz variable add 'v' in front of the Domoticz variable ID. 

Example::

    blocks['v3'] = {    //Select variable with Domoticz index 3
      title: 'My variable 3'
    }

After that you can use ``'v3'`` in your column definitions in ``CONFIG.js`` as usual.

A list of all Domoticz variables can be obtained via::

Usage
-----

Example of a block definition::

    var blocks = {}

    blocks[1] = {
      width: 4,               //1 to 12, remove this line if you want to use the default (4)
      title : 'Living room',  //if you want change the name of switch different then domoticz
      icon : 'fa-eye',        //if you want an other icon instead of the default, choose from: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free
      image : 'bulb_off.png', //if you want to show an image instead if icon, place image in img/ folder
      switch : true,          //if you want to switch the title and data
      hide_data : true,       //if you want to hide the data of this block
      last_update : true,     //if you want to show the last update specific for this block
      playsound : 'sounds/ping.mp3', //play a sound when a device changes
      protected : true,       //protect switching manually in Dashticz
      speak : 'Device status has changed',  //speak text when device is changed
      gotoslide: 2            //Goto screen when a device changes
    };  

Device with subdevices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a device consists of several subdevices, like a TempHumBar device or SmartMeter, then for each subdevice a block will be generated.

In this example device device 659 is a TempHumBar device::

  columns[1] = {
    blocks: [659]
  }

.. image :: img/block659.jpg

In case I want to show all four subdevices onto one row I've to change the default width from 4 to 3::

  blocks[659] = {
    width:4
  }
  columns[1] = {
    blocks: [659]
  }

.. image :: img/block659_w3.jpg

Now assume I want to have the first 3 subdevices on one row, and the fourth device on a new row, full width, with some additional customizations::

  blocks[659] = {
    width:4
  }

  blocks['659_4'] = {
    width:12,
    title: 'Dew temperature of device 659',
    icon: 'fas fa-bus',
    last_update: 'false',
    switch: true
  }

  columns[1] = {
    blocks: [659]
  }

  In the previous example first the settings of ``block[659]`` will be applied to all subblocks, followed by a subblock if it has been defined.
  (In this case ``blocks['659_4']``)

.. image :: img/block659_4_custom.jpg

In case you only want to show subdevice 1, the column definition should be as follows::

  columns[1] = {
    blocks: [ '659_1' ]
  }

Don't forget the tick marks around ``659_1``

As for single device it's also possible to use a custom block key in combination with the ``idx`` parameter.

To make this visible I've defined two classes in custom.css::

  .css_red {
    background-color: red !important;
  }

  .css_green {
    background-color: green !important;
  }

Now I'll add the temperature twice, with different backgrounds::

  blocks['659_1'] = {
    addClass: 'css_red'
  }

  blocks['another'] = {
    idx: '659_1',
    addClass: 'css_green'
  }

  columns[1] = {
    blocks: [ '659_1', 'another' ]
  }

.. image :: img/659_1_2.jpg  

You can also change a subdevice of a block with custom key::

  blocks['another'] = { //This block will show domoticz device 659
    idx: 659,
    addClass: 'css_red'
  }

  blocks['another_1'] = { //This block will be applied to subdevice 1 of "another"
    addClass: 'css_green'
  }

  columns[1] = {
    blocks: [ 'another' ]
  }

.. image :: img/block_another.jpg



Thermostat devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a thermostat IDX, IDX_1 or IDX_2 can be used.
If IDX_1 is used the thermostat +/- buttons will not be shown.
If IDX_2 is used the icon/image of the block can be changed as in a normal block.

::

    blocks['123_2'] = {
        image: 'toon.png'
    } 


Usage of popup graph window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the popup parameter you can configure to open a popup graph window. Example::

   blocks[258] = {
      title: 'Consumption',
      flash: 500,
      width: 4,
      popup: 'popup_consumption'
   }

In this example, the specified popup will use a defined graph called 'popup_consumption' instead of the default popup. This defined graph is then added to the config.js just like a normal graph::
  
   blocks['popup_consumption'] = {
      title: 'Energy Consumption Popup',
      devices: [258],
      toolTipStyle: true,
      datasetColors: ['red', 'yellow'],
      graph: 'line',
      legend: {
         'v_258' : 'Usage',          
         'c_258' : 'Total'
      }
   }


.. _openpopup :

Usage of openpopup(On)(Off)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the openpopup, openpopupOn and openpopupOff parameter you can configure to open a popup window when the device changes. Example::

  blocks[123]['openpopup'] = {
      url: 'http://www.urltocamera.nl/image.jpg',   //Open a popup window with this url when the device changes
      framewidth:500,                               //specific width of the frame
      frameheight:400,                              //specific height of the frame
      autoclose: 5                                  //autoclose the popup window after 5 seconds.
  } 
  
  blocks[123]['openpopupOn'] = {
      url: 'http://www.urltocamera.nl/image.jpg',   //Open a popup window with this url when the device changes to On
      framewidth:500,                               //specific width of the frame
      frameheight:400,                              //specific height of the frame
      autoclose: 5                                  //autoclose the popup window after 5 seconds.
  } 
  
  blocks[123]['openpopupOff'] = {
      url: 'http://www.urltocamera.nl/image.jpg',   //Open a popup window with this url when the device changes to Off
      framewidth:500,                               //specific width of the frame
      frameheight:400,                              //specific height of the frame
      autoclose: 5                                  //autoclose the popup window after 5 seconds.
  } 

To remove the close button of the block-popup add the following text to custom.css::

  .frameclose { display: none; }


.. _Flashonchange:

Flash on change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To control the flashing of the block when it's value change you can set the ``flash`` parameter.
Via the style ``blockchange`` in ``custom.css`` you can set the class-style that needs to be applied.

Example ``CONFIG.js``::

  blocks[123] = {             //123 is the Domoticz device ID
    title: 'My new device',
    flash: 500                //flash effect of 500 ms
  }
  
Example ``custom.css`` (only needed in case you want to change the default flash effect)::

  .blockchange {
    background-color: #0f0 !important;	
  }
  
.. _Evohome:

Evohome
~~~~~~~

The following Domoticz devices can be represented with a dial. See :ref:`dial`
   * EvoHome devices
   * Thermostats
   * Dimmers

.. image :: img/evohome.png

The following config parameters from CONFIG.js are applicable:

.. list-table:: 
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 5 30
  :class: tight-table

  * - Parameter
    - Description
  * - evohome_status
    - ``'Auto'``: 
  * - evohome_boost_zone
    - ``<number>``: Zone boost temporary override time in minutes. Default: 60
  * - evohome_boost_hw
    - ``<number>``: Hot water boost temporary override time in minutes. Default: 15

The EvoHome devices can be represented as dial by adding ``type: 'dial'`` to the block definition.

.. image :: img/dial.png


.. _formatting:

Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~

You can define the default unit text and number of decimals to show for some (most?) blocks by adding the following to CONFIG.js::

    config['units'] = {
      names: {
        kwh: 'kWh',
        watt: 'W',
        gas: 'm3',
        water: 'l',
        time: ''
      },
      decimals: {
        kwh: 1,
        watt: 0,
        gas: 1,
        water: 0,
        time: 0
      }
    }

You can also define the unit parameter on block level by setting the ``unit`` parameter::

    blocks[123] = {
      unit: 'Watt'
    }

.. _colorpicker:

RGB Color picker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By setting the block parameter ``colorpicker`` to a non-zero value a color picker dropdown button will be added to a RGB device.

With ``colorpicker:1`` the old style colorpicker will be added:

.. image :: img/colorpicker1.jpg

With ``colorpicker:2`` the enhanced colorpicker will be selected.
The colorpicker configuration depends on the RGB type.
The behavior is the same as in Domoticz.


The following Domoticz RGB devices are supported:

* RGB: Plain RGB dimmer
* RGBW: RGB dimmer with white modus
* RGBWW: RGB dimmer with white modus and adjustable white color temperature
* RGBWZ: Dimmer with seperate adjustable levels for RGB and White leds
* RGBWWZ: Adjustable levels for RGB and White, adjustable white color temperature

.. figure :: img/cprgb.jpg

   RGB device

.. figure :: img/cprgbw.jpg
  
  RGBW device in white modus.

.. figure :: img/cprgbwwz.jpg

   RGBWWZ device in Mixed modus.

   In this last example you see from left to right the RGB color picker, the RGB color level, the white color temperature, the white level and the master level.
