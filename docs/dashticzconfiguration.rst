Dashticz configuration
======================

Dashticz can be configured by editing the ``CONFIG.js`` file.
This file you can find in the subfolder ``[dashticz]/custom``.

.. note:: TIP! If CUSTOM POSITIONING is not working check if you have uncomment all lines from the blocks/colums/screens you want.

In the following part, the ``CONFIG.js`` is divided in sections. For each section there will be an explanation how to use.

First part describes setting up the configuration of the Domoticz connection. After that an overview of all configuration parameters can be found.

    .. _config-connection:

Connection

Below the basic configuration to make the connection with Domoticz work.

.. code-block:: bash

    var config = {}
    config['language'] = 'nl_NL'; //or: en_US, de_DE, fr_FR, hu_HU, it_IT, pt_PT, sv_SE

.. _urlparameters:

Dashticz URL parameters
#######################

Dashticz parameters can be configured via the Dashticz URL as well. For instance, to start Dashticz with a custom title and set the dashticz refresh period to 300 minutes, use the following URL::

  http://<dashticz-ip:port>/?app_title=Living room&dashticz_refresh=300

Besides the Dashticz configuration parameters, the following additional parameters can be used in the Dashticz URL: 


.. list-table:: 
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 5, 30
  :class: tight-table
   
  * - Parameter
    - Description
  * - cfg 
    - | The Dashticz configuration file to be used instead of CONFIG.js.
      | ``CONFIG.room2.js``
  * - cfg2 
    - | The name of a second configuration file, which will be loaded after CONFIG.js.
      | ``CONFIG.extra.js``
  * - css 
    - | The CSS file to be used instead of custom.css.
      | ``custom.mobile.css``
  * - folder 
    - | The folder containing the configuration files. (Default: ``custom``)
      | ``custom/room1``

So, to load Dashticz with a different config file, use the following URL::

  http://<dashticz ip:port>/?cfg=CONFIG.room2.js

The URL parameters can be accessed in CONFIG.js or custom.js via the global variable _PARAMS::

    if (_PARAMS['myownparam']=='2') {
       screen[2].columns = [2,4,5]
    }
      


Usage
#####

.. _dom_CORS_proxy:

PHP based CORS proxy
--------------------

To be able to load resources from other domains, like tvguide data and news updates, we need a CORS proxy (Cross Origin Resouce Sharing). Public CORS proxies exist on the internet, like cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com. These public CORS proxies might be slow or not available at all.

A basic PHP based CORS proxy has been integrated into Dashticz.

For normal use just remove the ``config['default_cors_url']`` from your ``CONFIG.js`` and the internal CORS proxy will be used.

If you prefer to use a different CORS proxy you can define it in ``CONFIG.js`` as usual::

    config['default_cors_url'] = 'http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com'

In case PHP is not installed it falls back to the defined CORS proxy in ``config['default_cors_url']``. In case ``config['default_cors_url']`` is not set, it will use ``cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com`` by default.

.. _websocket:

Websocket connection
---------------------

From v4.11000 Domoticz supports a so called websocket connection next to the standard http(s) connection.

.. note:: Currently the Domoticz stable version is 4.10717 which doesn't support the websocket connection. That means you have to update to the Domoticz develop branch.

.. warning:: The Domoticz develop branch may give issues, especially on Raspberry PI. Make a backup of Domoticz first! If you switch to the develop branch, the Domoticz database will be upgraded as well, and cannot be downgraded.

The advantages of a websocket connection:

* instant updates in Dashticz in case of a changing Domoticz device
* Faster and less overhead

To prevent switching to a websocket connection add the following setting to CONFIG.js::

  config['enable_websocket'] = false;

In the <gif> below you see the instant updates in action. On the right you see the Domoticz dashboard. On the left Dashticz.
