v3.10.1: Change in HTML template for special blocks
===================================================

Garbage
--------

Previously the default garbage type was 'black', meaning in case the garbage type could not be derived from the garbage description the black garbage icon would be selected.

In this release a new block parameter ``defaultGarbage`` has been added to define which garbage type to use in case garbage type is unknown.

The default value is 'kerstboom'. 

(The reason is that there is a garbage provider that didn't provide a garbage description on the day that kerstbomen are being collected)

So if you now see the kerstboom icon appearing at unexpected days just add ``defaultGarbage: 'black'`` as block paramter to get the old behavior.
