.. _v3_12_1:

v3.12.0.1: Update chart module
===================================================


Main changes are summarized below.

Default charts
---------------

For some device types (P1 smart meter, Temp/Hum/Bar devices) Dashticz will add some default settings.

If you don't want to make use of the default settings add the following block parameter::

    usedefaults: false

The legend will be added by default. To show no legend use the following block parameter::

    legend: false


Dataset numbering
-----------------

Example::

    blocks['three_temp_devices'] = {
       type: 'graph',
       devices: [ 12, 13, 14],
       usedefaults: false
    }

In previous versions the device idx was added to each dataset label, resulting in the following three datasets::

    te_12
    te_13
    te_14

In the current version, no suffix will be added to first the dataset label.
The dataset of the second graph device will have '_1' as suffix.
That means the block definition above will give the following two datasets::

    te
    te_1
    te_2

New block parameter ``datasets``
--------------------------------

Use the ``datasets`` block parameter to set options for each dataset

    blocks['three_temp_devices'] = {
       type: 'graph',
       devices: [ 12, 13, 14],
       datasets: {
          te: {
            legend: 'Temp 1',
          },
          te_1: {
            legend: 'Temp 2'
          },
          te_2: {
             legend: 'Temp 3'
          }
        }     
    }

Example of the options can be set for each dataset:

    * ``hideData: true`` to hide the dataset completely
    * ``hidefromlegend: true`` to hide the dataset from the legend only
    * ``legend: 'Temp 1'`` to set the name of the dataset in the legend
    * ``yAxis: 'yaxis'`` Name of the y-axis that will be used for this dataset
    * ``yLabel: '(m3)'`` to use '(m3)' as label behind the data in the tooltip
