3.7.2 Beta (27-12-2020)
-----------------------

.. note:: Update instructions.

I've removed custom/custom.css and custom/custom.js from the Dashticz repository,  because these are user configuration files, and should not be part of the Dashticz repository.

However, that means this update cannot be installed with ``git pull`` directly, because then git will report an error if you have modified one or both files.

To solve this, first make a backup of these two files::

  mv custom/custom.js custom/custom.js.bak
  mv custom/custom.css custom/custom.css.bak

In case you use the custom_2 folder, repeat these steps for that folder::

  mv custom_2/custom.js custom_2/custom.js.bak
  mv custom_2/custom.css custom_2/custom.css.bak

Then update to the latest version as usual::

  git pull

And restore your backups::

  mv custom/custom.js.bak custom/custom.js
  mv custom/custom.css.bak custom/custom.css

And for the custom_2 folder::

  mv custom_2/custom.js.bak custom_2/custom.js
  mv custom_2/custom.css.bak custom_2/custom.css

You only have to do this once: Next updates can be installed with a normal 'git pull'
