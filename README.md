# Dashticz
Alternative dashboard for Domoticz.

The Dashboard of Domoticz is quite powerful. The disadvantage is that it's only possible to show information known in Domoticz.
There is where Dashticz steps in. Dashticz is able to show (almost) all Domoticz information.
In addition to that it's possible to show information from all kind of other sources.
