## 1. Cleaning up unused files

### What was removed and why

Several files were removed because they were either dead code, personal test
data, or duplicate backup copies that no longer serve any purpose in the
project.


#### Dead/backup JavaScript source files

| Removed file | Reason |
|---|---|
| `js/thermostat.js` | Replaced by `js/components/thermostat.js` a long time ago; this file was never loaded |
| `js/chromecast.js` | Chromecast support code that was never wired into the dashboard |
| `js/domoticz-api.js_org` | Backup copy with `.js_org` extension — not loaded by the browser |
| `js/main.js_org`, `js/settings.js_org`, etc. | Additional backup copies — not loaded by the browser |
| `js/components/group.js_org`, `js/components/weather.js_org` | Same as above |

#### Root-level config and tooling files

| Removed file | Reason |
|---|---|
| `.babelrc` | Superseded by `build/babel.config.js` |
| `.prettierrc` | Moved to `build/prettier.json` |
| `.prettierignore` | Moved to `build/prettierignore` |
| `babel.config.js` | Moved to `build/babel.config.js` |
| `webpack.config.js` | Moved to `build/webpack.config.js` |
| `jsconfig.json` | VS Code helper file, not needed in the repository |
| `.jsbeautifyrc` | Not used (project uses Prettier) |
| `.eslintrc.js` | Not used (no ESLint run in the current workflow) |
| `.browserslistrc` | Browserslist config consolidated into `package.json` |
| `.dockerignore`, `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf` | Docker deployment files removed (not part of the standard install) |
| `Makefile` | Replaced by `npm run build` / `npm test` |
| `scripts/bu.sh`, `scripts/dashticz_install.sh` | Installer and backup helper scripts removed |
| `playwright.config.js` | Playwright end-to-end test configuration removed (tests are Jest-based) |

#### Duplicate HTML entry point

`index2.html` — a second dashboard entry point that was never documented or
maintained — has been removed. The only entry point is `index.html`.

#### Upload helper

`vendor/dashticz/upload.php` — a bare PHP upload helper (no authentication,
no file-type check) has been removed. It was not integrated into the dashboard
UI. **If a custom integration referred to this endpoint it will stop working.**

#### Dead slider functions in `js/switches.js`

The internal `sliderAction` helper object and `slideDeviceExt()` function were
removed. Both were unused (`slideDeviceExt` had a comment "Function not used?")
and have been replaced by the live slider code in the component layer.

#### Simplification of `js/components/nzbget.js`

The NZBGet callback was using a string reference (`'returnNZBGET'`) instead of
the actual function reference. This has been corrected. **No configuration
change is required.**

#### Documentation folder

The entire `docs/` folder (RST sources + Sphinx theme) has been removed from
the repository. The live documentation is maintained separately at
<https://dashticz.readthedocs.io>. **This does not affect users; it only affects
contributors who want to build the docs locally.**

#### Log and diagnostic tools

`log.html` moved to `tools/log.html`. `switch_horizon.php` moved to
`tools/switch_horizon.php`. The dashboard automatically redirects calls to the
new location, so no configuration change is required for Ziggo/UPC users.

---

### Documentation pages that may need updating

| Page | What to add / change |
|---|---|
| **Getting started / Installation** | Mention that `index2.html` no longer exists; only `index.html` is used |
| **Configuration / Blocks / Switch** (`switch_horizon.php`) | Note that the helper has moved to `tools/switch_horizon.php`; existing configs are auto-redirected |
| **Development** (if it exists) | Build config files are now in the `build/` directory instead of the project root |

---

## 2. Bootstrap update from 3.4 to 5.3

### Summary

Bootstrap has been upgraded from **3.4.1** to **5.3.8**. Because Bootstrap 5
removes many features and renames almost all data attributes, a dedicated
**compatibility layer** has been added so that existing dashboards, themes, and
`custom/custom.css` files continue to work without changes in most cases.

### What changed under the hood

| Area | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| Bootstrap version | 3.4.1 | 5.3.8 |
| Chart.js | 2.9.4 | 4.5.1 |
| chart.js zoom plugin | 0.7.7 | 2.2.0 |
| Date/time library | Moment.js 2.29 + handlebars.moment | Day.js 1.11 |
| Swiper | 8.x | 12.x |
| jQuery | 3.5.x | 3.7.1 |
| Font Awesome | 6.0 | 6.7 |

### Compatibility layer (`src/bootstrap-compat.js` and `src/_bootstrap3-compat.scss`)

A JavaScript file and a SCSS file were added that translate Bootstrap 3
patterns to Bootstrap 5 at run time:

- **Data attribute aliases** — `data-toggle`, `data-target`, `data-dismiss`,
  `data-parent`, `data-ride`, `data-interval`, `data-slide`, `data-slide-to`,
  `data-backdrop`, `data-keyboard` are all silently mapped to their `data-bs-*`
  equivalents.
- **Grid classes** — `col-xs-*` and other Bootstrap 3 grid helpers are mapped
  to their Bootstrap 5 counterparts.
- **Modals, dropdowns, tabs, collapses, carousels** — Bootstrap 3 jQuery calls
  (e.g. `$(...).modal('show')`) are intercepted and forwarded to the Bootstrap 5
  API.
- **Button groups / selector buttons** — Radio and checkbox button groups are
  isolated so selecting a button in one group does not affect another group.
  The active button retains its highlight colour and dispatches the correct
  value. This fixes a pre-existing bug with selector blocks.
- **Visibility helpers** — `.hidden`, `.show`, `.visible-xs`, etc. are kept
  working.
- **Alignment and float classes** — `.pull-left`, `.pull-right`,
  `.text-left`, `.text-right` remain functional.
- **Camera carousel** — the camera block template has been updated to use
  Bootstrap 5 carousel markup; the configuration interface is unchanged.

### Chart.js 4 compatibility layer (`src/chart-compat.js`)

Existing graph block configurations written for Chart.js 2.x are
automatically converted at run time:

- `scaleLabel` → `title`
- `gridLines` → `grid`
- `fontColor` / `fontSize` in ticks → `color` / `font`
- Axis tick-level `min`/`max`/`suggestedMin`/`suggestedMax` moved to the axis root
- `tooltips` → `tooltip`
- `hover` callbacks → `interaction`/`plugins` equivalents
- Dataset-level font/color properties normalized
- Zoom plugin configuration migrated to the `chartjs-plugin-zoom` 2.x API

**No changes to `CONFIG.js` graph definitions are required** for standard graph
blocks. Heavily customized graphs that pass raw `Chart.js` options may
need a review.

### Day.js as a drop-in for Moment.js

`moment` (the global function and object) is still available after the upgrade.
All standard `moment(...)` calls work as before including:

- `moment().format(...)` with existing format strings
- `moment().locale(lang)` with any of the Dashticz-supported locales
- Unix timestamp parsing: `moment.unix(ts)`, `moment(ts * 1000)`
- Relative time: `.fromNow()`, `.toNow()`
- Date arithmetic: `.add()`, `.subtract()`, `.startOf()`, `.endOf()`
- Handlebars helper `{{moment date format="..."}}` (from `handlebars.moment`)

**Configuration keys that control date/time formatting
(`calendarformat`, `calendarLanguage`, etc.) are unchanged.**

### What could break with custom CSS

If `custom/custom.css` contains rules that directly target Bootstrap internal
class names or variables (e.g. `.navbar-default`, `@{color-base}`) these may
need to be updated to Bootstrap 5 equivalents. Rules that target Dashticz block
classes (e.g. `.dt_block`, `.dt_button`, `.block_frame`) should continue to
work normally.

### Screensaver fix

The screensaver inactivity timer now resets from the **last real user
interaction**, including touches that close the screensaver. Previously, the
timer could restart from the wrong base time, causing the screensaver to
re-activate too quickly.

---

### Documentation pages that may need updating

| Page | What to add / change |
|---|---|
| **Getting started / Dependencies** | Update Bootstrap version to 5.3 |
| **Configuration / Graphs** | Note that Chart.js 2.x options are auto-converted; heavy custom options may need review |
| **Configuration / Calendar** (`calendarformat`, `calendarlanguage`) | Confirm that Moment.js format strings are still valid (they are) |
| **Configuration / Blocks / Camera** | Camera carousel now uses Bootstrap 5 markup internally; user config unchanged |
| **Configuration / Screensaver** | Note improved inactivity timer behaviour |
| **Custom CSS / Themes** | Add a note that Bootstrap 5 renamed some internal classes; advise checking custom overrides |
| **Selector block** | Document the fix: each selector button group is now independent and active state is preserved |

---

## 3. Calendar fixes and backward compatibility

### Background

After the Bootstrap and Day.js upgrade, the calendar block stopped rendering in
some dashboards. Investigation showed two causes:

1. Dashboards created with **Dashticz 3.14 or earlier** used a different
   calendar block format (`calendars` array instead of `icalurl` object).
2. The same older dashboards also used a property called `calFormat` (a number)
   instead of the new `layout` property.

### What changed in `js/components/calendar.js`

#### Backward-compatible `calendars` array support

Old (Dashticz ≤ 3.14) CONFIG.js calendar block format:

```javascript
var blocks = {
  'mycal': {
    type: 'calendar',
    calendars: [
      { color: 'lightblue', calendar: { icalurl: 'https://...', adjustTZ: 1 } },
      { color: 'lightgreen', calendar: { icalurl: 'https://...' } }
    ]
  }
};
```

New (Dashticz 3.15+) CONFIG.js calendar block format:

```javascript
var blocks = {
  'mycal': {
    type: 'calendar',
    icalurl: {
      work:    { ics: 'https://...', color: 'lightblue' },
      private: { ics: 'https://...', color: 'lightgreen' }
    },
    adjustTZ: 1
  }
};
```

Both formats are now supported simultaneously. **If your dashboard still uses
the old `calendars` array format it will continue to work without any change.**

The `adjustTZ` and `adjustAllDayTZ` properties from individual calendar entries
in the old format are promoted to the block level (the first value found is
used).

#### Backward-compatible `calFormat` → `layout` mapping

Old format used `calFormat: 0|1|2` to control the calendar display mode. The
current property name is `layout`. Both are now accepted. **No change required
in `CONFIG.js` if you use `calFormat`.**

#### `canHandle` check extended

The `canHandle` function now recognizes blocks that carry a `calendars` array
even when `icalurl` is absent. This means calendar blocks in the old format are
correctly identified and rendered.

### Calendar configuration reference (current)

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | — | Must be `'calendar'` |
| `icalurl` | object \| string | — | One or more calendar sources. Object keys are arbitrary names; each value has `ics` (URL) and optionally `color`. A plain string URL is also accepted for a single calendar. |
| `calendars` | array | — | **(Legacy)** Array of `{ color, calendar: { icalurl, adjustTZ, adjustAllDayTZ } }` objects. Still supported; converted automatically. |
| `layout` | number | `0` | Display layout: `0` = list, `1` = list with click-to-full-screen, `2` = week grid |
| `calFormat` | number | — | **(Legacy)** Alias for `layout`. Still supported. |
| `adjustTZ` | number | `0` | Timezone offset in hours to apply to event times |
| `adjustAllDayTZ` | boolean \| number | `false` | Apply timezone adjustment to all-day events |
| `maxitems` | number | `15` | Maximum number of events to show |
| `weeks` | number | `5` | Number of weeks to look ahead |
| `lastweek` | boolean | `true` | Include events from the past 7 days |
| `isoweek` | boolean | `false` | Start week on Monday (ISO week) instead of Sunday |
| `dateFormat` | string | `'ddd DD/MM/YY'` | Date format string (Moment-compatible) |
| `timeFormat` | string | `'HH:mm'` | Time format string (Moment-compatible) |
| `startonly` | boolean | `false` | Show only the event start time, not the end time |

Global calendar settings in `CONFIG.js`:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| `config['calendarurl']` | Default URL for the built-in Domoticz Google Calendar integration |
| `config['calendarformat']` | Default date format string |
| `config['calendarlanguage']` | Locale code for day/month names (e.g. `'nl'`, `'de'`) |

### Documentation pages that may need updating

| Page | What to add / change |
|---|---|
| **Configuration / Blocks / Calendar** | Add the full configuration table above; document both `icalurl` (new) and `calendars` (legacy, still supported); document `calFormat` as a legacy alias for `layout` |
| **Migration guide** (new page or section) | Explain how to convert from the old `calendars` array format to the new `icalurl` object format |
| **Configuration / Settings** | Confirm `calendarurl`, `calendarformat`, `calendarlanguage` still work as before |
